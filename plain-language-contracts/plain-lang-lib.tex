\newcommand{development}{
\section{Development}
The details for the design, development, and engineering for full completion of the outlined proposal to yield maximum value to You.
  \subsection{Hardware Requirements}
  You will need one (1) or more spin ups of VPS or SSD servers for website hosting, software hosting, email hosting, domain hosting, database hosting, and other services related to hosting. If you already have a hosting service, We will strongly recommend that You transfer your hosting upon acceptance of this Agreement to guarantee maximum performance and support for your product(s). We recommend a solution similar to a state-of-the-art private Private Cloud from Liquid Web, located in Lansing, Michigan. While Liquid Web is an excellent choiuce, if you have highly sensitive material that you want to keep protected, we can also make a recommendation for an offshore host in a privacy-friendly country like Iceland or Switzerland. It may be prudent to deploy two separate instances of this project.

  We guarantee 99.9\% uptime with the only exceptions being during scheduled downtime for infrequent large scale updates or in the event of a massive power outage, natural disaster, act of war or terrorism, or an act of god. You will receive prompt communication from Us in the event that your network experiences downtime.

  We provide the provide the latest and most highly-sophisticated security protocols and guarantee little to no reduction in performance due to increased traffic or user volume. The decision on how many server instances to deploy and the price of these vary depending on the size needed, which will require further analysis and knowledge obtained after the acceptance of this Agreement.

  \subsection{Domain and Software Hosting}
  To transfer your current content, domains, and associated accounts, We will need access to your account with your current host in order to work directly with them to transfer the content. We do not charge for the transfer of content. However, you are obligated to pay any cancellation or transfer fees from your previous host. They may charge anywhere from \$35USD to \$50USD as a transfer fee for each unique domain name, which will also extend your ownership of the domain(s) for an additional year. Beyond that, they will bill you said fee on an annual basis to retain ownership of the domain(s).

  If you wish to purchase additional domain names, We will do so on your behalf. However, You are responsible for the additional fees charged per domain.

  For your convenience, We will change the WHOIS documentation associated with your domain(s) to list Us as representative of You as the Registrar in order to maintain the privacy of You as clients, prevent solicitation by telemarketers, and other domain-related nuisances. We are obligated to forward any relevant information pertaining to your domain directly to You and will never act upon any such information prior to receiving your consent.
  \subsection{Software Requirements}
    \subsubsection{Languages}
    We create fully-optimized web designs using the latest techniques and build flexible layouts that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. We create designs iteratively and use the latest version and/or framework of widely-accepted markup and object-oriented programming langauges such as
    I create full optimized web designs using the latest modern web design techniques and build flexible layouts that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. I create designs iteratively and use the latest iterations and/or framework of widely accepted markup and object-oriented programming languages such as HTML, SVG, CSS, PHP, Javascript, Ruby, Python, Go, C, C#, and C++ for optimization and to reduce the need for static visuals. We may use static visuals to indicate a creative direction (color, texture, and typography.) We refer to this as “atmosphere."
    \subsubsection{Tools}
    We will require various tools necessary for maximal success. We will also need your permission to act as a representative of You while aquiring and using these tools. We will provide a list of tools we will need to use to as we proceed with development. If You have not obtained any of the tools We use, We will set them up for you. By accepting this Agreement, you agree to incur the incidental expenses that may be necessary to obtain the tools We require.
    \subsubsection{Services}
    We will require the use of various services in order to achieve maximum success while executing your project. We will need your permission to act as a representative of You while acquiring and using these services. We will provide a list of services that We will need to use as we proceed with development. If you have not obtained or set up any of the services that We require, We will obtain and/or set them up for You. By accepting this Agreement, you agree to incur the incidental costs that may be necessary to obtain the services we require.

% DESIGN APPROACH SECTION
%———————————————————————————————————————
\newcommand{\designapproach}{
\section{Approach to Design}
We take an algorithmic approach to delivery on a project. We have outlined below a brief overview of our step-by-step approach to problem solving and apply it to each key element of your project.
  \subsection{Objective}
  We develop webpages, applications, and software that have a singular objective: obtaining and capturing eyeballs. We deploy a strategy that ensures that the path to this objective reamins streamlined. We refer to this as a software's or webpage's Eyeball Retention Rate (\textbf{``ERR''}). Maximum ERR is only obtainable in one way: We become the eyeballs by putting ourselves in the end-user's shoes.
  \subsection{Infiltration}
  We insert ourselves, other key people, and our technology as members of the community where You are seeking to maximize ERR. By walking a mile in the end-user's or consumer's shoes, We are able to make adoption and usability as the key factors in our decision making process as We move through the development process.
  \subsection{Design}
  We learn about the standards in user interface and user experience (UI/UX) that are currently available and used by the most familiar companies in your industry. We evaluate how the details of our findings stack up against compared to the most modern standards of UI/UX and seek out a covergence point between a website or software's interface and experience that is tailored to the end-user. We therefore maximize eyeballs by minimizing extremes.
  \subsection{Development}
  We use the knowledge gained from the Infiltration phase and the limitations set forth by the scope of the project and general design principles to then work on developing a concept. We build projects using techniques that generate a perception of professionalism, innovation, community, and equality between You and the end-user. This means that we must be careful not to expand too far in any one direction for fear of losing grasp of another.
  \subsection{Deployment}
  We make a reasonable best effort to ensure that the user experience of your website stays consistent on all devices. However, we may need to alter, limit, or otherwise change the layout to ensure maximum usability.
  \subsection{Testing}
  Testing no longer means attempting to make the product look the same in all browsers or on all devices. It has now converged to fluid, full-stack testing and optimization throughout the product to maximize current ERR, acquire new eyeballs, and maintain the highest standard appropriate for end use.
    \subsubsection{Browsers}
    We test our work in the two most current versions of major available browsers. We won't test in other, older browsers unless we agree to that separately. If you need an enhanced deisgn for an older browser, We can provide a separate estimte for that.
  \subsection{Support}
  We will continue to maintain the infrastructure of the environments We have built for You until We accomplish everything You've told Us that You want to achieve in the timefram specified in \ref. That being said, We are happy to be flexible; if You want to change your mind or add something new, that won't be a problem. You may incur additional cost for execution of your project, though.

\section{Confidentiality}\label{confidential-information}
    \subsection{Definition of Confidential Information}
    For our purposes, we will define \textbf{``Confidential Information''} as any information (or combinations of individual pieces of information) that relate Your business, business plans and methods, current and planned products, and any research or development that You may be conducting. Similarly, Our confidential information includes any information (or combination of pieces of information) that relate to Our business, business plans and methods, current and planned products or services, and any research or development that We or our subsisdiaries or related companies may be involved in.

    This includes, but is not limited to, Your and Our customers and vendors, any technology (including software and hardware), designs, drawings, engineering, marketing plans or ideas, financial status or statements, and any other business information that one Party may disclose to the other in the process of executing this Agreement.

    Confidential Inforamtion does NOT include any information that either Party can establish (i) was publicly available before disclosure, (ii) becomes publicly available after disclosure through no wrongdoing of either Party, and (iii) is in the rightful possession of either Party, without an obligation for confidentiality, as long as it can be proven by previously exisiting written records. To be clear, just because one piece of information is disclosed, publicly available, or in prior possession of either Party, confidentiality obligations still exist for any collective whole that the single piece of information may be a part of—unless the entire combination falls with the exceptions just laid out.

    \subsection{Nonuse and Nondisclosure}\label{nondisclosure}
    During and after the term of this Agreement, We and You will hold Confidential Information in the strictest confidence and take any and all reasonable precations to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of that Confidential Information. We will not use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than to execute the services on Your behalf and We also agree not to disclose the Confidential Information to any third part without Your prior written consent. You also agree to follow the same measures just laid out regarding any and all Confidential Information that We may disclose to You while We are performing the services.
    During and after the term of this Agreement, \ will hold in the strictest confidence and take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information.

    \subsection{Personally Identifying Information}
    \textbf{``Personally Identifiable Information''} or \textbf{``PII''} means the information concerning a natural person which can be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate that person. The terms relating to nonuse and nondisclosure discussed in Subsection \ref{nondisclosure} shall also be extended to any Personally Identifiable Information that is also stored, accessed, transmitted, or received by Us and You. In the case of Us making a business referral using PII to \clientbusinessname or You making a business referral to \ludu, all that is required is verbal or written consent.

        By signing this Agreement, You waive your right to a jury trial and understand and acknowledge that You would otherwise be able to sue in court. Your waiver is intended to encompass any and all disputes related to this Agreement that might be filed in any court.

        Any disagreement about this Agreement, its interpretation, termination, any updates made to it, enforcement of the Agreement, or the general validity of this Agreement will be settled before a single arbitrator in \companycity, \companystate, \companycountry. If it's relevant, the judgement of the arbitrator may be entered into any court that has jurisdiction. This subsection does not prevent You or Us from seeking provisional measures from a relevant court.

        To save You and Us time and money the unforuante and unlikely circumstance that we find ourselves having a disagreement, the following subsection is meant to set the basic terms of any potential abritration proceeding:

          \subsubsection{Essential Terms of Arbitration}
          The Arbitrator will be selected and the hearing conducted under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (the \textbf{``AAA''}). During the life of this Agreement, the Parties may mutually agree to use the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service of the United States of America for such purposes or a system where the Arbitrator is selected from a mutually agreed-upon panel of Arbitrators.

          The expenses and fees billed by the Arbitrator will be paid by the losing Party. The filing fee will be paid by the losing Party. The expenses of a hearing reporter will be paid by the Party making such a request unless the Parties jointly agree to share such costs.

          A monetary award may be made for attorney or witness fees related to the grievance appeal.

          Either or both Parties may propose consolidation of grievance arbitration cases for arbitration hearings where the cases deal with similar issues. The Parties will continue to discuss expedited grievance arbitration or a mediation procedure as well as the types of cases which will be eligible for such expedited procedure.

          The Arbitrator will only have the authority to determine compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. The Arbitrator will be the judge of the relevance and materiality of the evidence offered and conformation to the general legal rules of evidence will not be necessary. The Arbitrator will not make any award which, in effect, would grant the You or Us any rights or privileges that were not already contained in the contract provisions.

          The decision of the Arbitrator will be final and binding on all Parties to this Agreement and the decision will not be appealable. The written decision of the Arbitrator shall be delivered within 30 calendar days from the closing of the record of the hearing. However, when the Arbitrator declares a bench decision, such decision shall be rendered in writing within 15 calendar days from the date of the Arbitration hearing. A written copy of the decision shall be provided, and, if available from either the Arbitrator or AAA, in electronic format (PDF) and sent to both Parties.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties shall also have the right to initiate an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other reasonable relief while a final decision from the Arbitrator is pending.

          To the furthest extent allowed by the law, You agree that:
          \begin{longenum}
            \item no arbitration action shall be joined with any other;
            \item there exists no right for any dispute to be arbitrated as a class-action or to utilize class action mechanisms; and
            \item there exists no right for any dispute to be brought in a representative capacity on the behalf of the public or any other uninvolved persons.
          \end{longenum}
          Should the provisions of this paragraph be found to be unenforceable, then the controversy, claim, or dispute shall be brought before the state or federal courts (the \textbf{``Courts''}) in \companycity, \companystate, \companycountry.

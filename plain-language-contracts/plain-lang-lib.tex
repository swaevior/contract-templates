\section{Preamble}
THIS \contracttitle (this \textbf{``Agreement''}) is intended to govern the relationship between \ludu (\textbf{``We,'' ``Us''}) and \clientbusinessname (\textbf{``You''}). The individuals that are party to this contract include \linguist and \developer on the behalf of \ludu as well as \clientname on the behalf of \clientbusinessname. While We plan to primarily interface with \clientname while we provde the services contained in this Agreement, this entire Agreement will apply to all members of Your organization.

On behalf of \clientbusinessname, \clientname wishes to engage \ludu for development, linguistic, or other services. \clientname asserts that he or she is authorized within the \clientbusinessname organization to engage in and enact a legally-binding business arrangement with \ludu.

\clientbusinessname's principal place of business is \clientaddress and \ludu operates principally from \luduaddress.

Dated as of \today (the \textbf{``Effective Date''}), this Agreement is made and entered by and between Us and You with the intention of being legally bound by the contents of this Agreement. Collectively, We and You may be each individually and collectively called \textbf{``Parties''} in this contract.

%	CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION SECTION
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\newcommand{\confidentialinformation}{
\section{Confidentiality}\label{confidential-information}
    \subsection{Definition of Confidential Information}
    For our purposes, we will define \textbf{``Confidential Information''} as any information (or combinations of individual pieces of information) that relate Your business, business plans and methods, current and planned products, and any research or development that You may be conducting. Similarly, Our confidential information includes any information (or combination of pieces of information) that relate to Our business, business plans and methods, current and planned products or services, and any research or development that We or our subsisdiaries or related companies may be involved in.

    This includes, but is not limited to, Your and Our customers and vendors, any technology (including software and hardware), designs, drawings, engineering, marketing plans or ideas, financial status or statements, and any other business information that one Party may disclose to the other in the process of executing this Agreement.

    Confidential Inforamtion does NOT include any information that either Party can establish (i) was publicly available before disclosure, (ii) becomes publicly available after disclosure through no wrongdoing of either Party, and (iii) is in the rightful possession of either Party, without an obligation for confidentiality, as long as it can be proven by previously exisiting written records. To be clear, just because one piece of information is disclosed, publicly available, or in prior possession of either Party, confidentiality obligations still exist for any collective whole that the single piece of information may be a part of—unless the entire combination falls with the exceptions just laid out.

    \subsection{Nonuse and Nondisclosure}\label{nondisclosure}
    During and after the term of this Agreement, We and You will hold Confidential Information in the strictest confidence and take any and all reasonable precations to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of that Confidential Information. We will not use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than to execute the services on Your behalf and We also agree not to disclose the Confidential Information to any third part without Your prior written consent. You also agree to follow the same measures just laid out regarding any and all Confidential Information that We may disclose to You while We are performing the services.
    During and after the term of this Agreement, \ will hold in the strictest confidence and take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information.

    \subsection{Personally Identifying Information}
    \textbf{``Personally Identifiable Information''} or \textbf{``PII''} means the information concerning a natural person which can be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate that person. The terms relating to nonuse and nondisclosure discussed in Subsection \ref{nondisclosure} shall also be extended to any Personally Identifiable Information that is also stored, accessed, transmitted, or received by Us and You. In the case of Us making a business referral using PII to \clientbusinessname or You making a business referral to \ludu, all that is required is verbal or written consent.

%-------------------------------------------------------------
\newcommand{\ownershipofCI}{
\section{Ownership of Confidential Information and PII}

If You need assistance with obtaining rights or permissions for material that You would like Us to use, We do offer Permissions Collection and Mangagement services and can provide You a quote for that.
  \subsection{}
  Following on from that, We guarantee that all elements of the work We deliver to You are either owned by Us or that We’ve obtained permission to provide them to You. When We provide text, images or other artwork to You, We agree to protect you from any claim by a third party that You’re using their Intellectual Property.

    \begin{longenum}
      \item You own all Intellectual Property rights of text, images, site specification and data You provided, unless someone else owns them. If You choose to pay for any of our additional services (e.g. photography, videography, copywriting, \latex typesetting, etc.), You will own all Intellectual Property rights of those products and will be provided with source files and finished files.
      \item We will maintain any Intellectual Property rights we’ve developed prior to, or developed separately from, this project and not paid for by You.
